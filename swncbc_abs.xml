</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Due to some audio issues, a LOT of reconstruction work went into this episode, but FINALLY it sees the light of day! Allegiance is the pre-Rise of Skywalker comic series detailing the events of the moments before the film - however, none of it seems to connect. AT ALL. What is happening with this? Thankfully this will be the last in our "boy this movie crushed us" series of episodes. Rebels season 4 is this weekend! Stay Tuned!</p> ]]>

Despite Alex's terrible... genuinely terrible Harrison Ford accent, they somehow manage to talk about their hopes and fears for the movie, and what they think of the director swap issues.

Diving deep into the trailer, they try to figure out what the plot of the movie will be and how it will all unfold. Then at the end, we talk about a VR experience we had at Disney where we entered Star Wars and lived a real rebel mission! All this and a special guest appearance by Hi-Bot in this all new SWNCBC episode! SWNCBC is Jesse Cox @JesseCox Alex Faciane @FacianeA Michael Davis @TeamDavis</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Darth Vader has been shot down and marooned on a planet surrounded by the rebel alliance. Of course he's going to kick their ass - but apparently that's not all the story Vader Down tells. In this special comic cross over, we learn more about Dr. Aphra, Luke's flirtation with the force, and Han and Leia's ever expanding relationship. It's pretty great - for something called Vader Down that doesn't feature much of Vader. They boys discuss all this and more in the newest SWNCBC!

<![CDATA[ <p>Darth Vader has been shot down and marooned on a planet surrounded by the rebel alliance. Of course he's going to kick their ass - but apparently that's not all the story Vader Down tells. In this special comic cross over, we learn more about Dr. Aphra, Luke's flirtation with the force, and Han and Leia's ever expanding relationship. It's pretty great - for something called Vader Down that doesn't feature much of Vader. They boys discuss all this and more in the newest SWNCBC! Please leave a comment or review on our itunes page, it would mean the world!</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>This episode we get in depth with the newest Star Wars aftermath book. Life Debt. A new villain appears, some much needed backstory is given on old characters, and our team of misfits finally comes together in a way we love. Shout out to Chuck Wendig for nailing this one, after we didn't too much care for the first. Lots of theories and "did you catch this?!" moments have sprung from this book and hopefully our discussion reflects that.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>This episode we get in depth with the newest Star Wars aftermath book. Life Debt. A new villain appears, some much needed backstory is given on old characters, and our team of misfits finally comes together in a way we love. Shout out to Chuck Wendig for nailing this one, after we didn't too much care for the first. Lots of theories and "did you catch this?!" moments have sprung from this book and hopefully our discussion reflects that.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The internet's Jesse Cox is joined by fellow Star Wars fans and friends Davis (Warp Zone) and Alex (The Dex) for a book club celebrating the new Star Wars lore. Our first book is the one all fans have been waiting for: Aftermath. We'll talk about its implications for the movie, what we thought of the first post-Episode VI novel, and some of our favorite parts. Warning: this podcast is for those who have read the book.</p> ]]>
