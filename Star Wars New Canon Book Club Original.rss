      <description>Due to some audio issues, a LOT of reconstruction work went into this episode, but FINALLY it sees the light of day! 
Allegiance is the pre-Rise of Skywalker comic series detailing the events of the moments before the film - however, none of it seems to connect. AT ALL. What is happening with this?
Thankfully this will be the last in our &quot;boy this movie crushed us&quot; series of episodes. 
Rebels season 4 is this weekend! Stay Tuned!</description>

      <itunes:summary>The boys sit down to talk the Solo trailer. Despite Alex's terrible... 
genuinely terrible Harrison Ford accent, they somehow manage to talk about their hopes and fears for the movie, and what they think of the director swap issues. Will Solo be amazing, or will it break nerdy hearts. Should it have been a Lando movie instead? Is it a bridge to a Lando movie? Do we just love Lando too much? Diving deep into the trailer, they try to figure out what the plot of the movie will be and how it will all unfold. Then at the end, we talk about a VR experience we had at Disney where we entered Star Wars and lived a real rebel mission! All this and a special guest appearance by Hi-Bot in this all new SWNCBC episode!
